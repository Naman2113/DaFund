# DaFund

## Inspiration 💡💡💡

With the recent boom in blockchain technology, we were inspired to build a bridge between cryptocurrency and philanthropy. There weren't any popular crowdfunding resources that allowed cryptocurrency transactions, so we decided to try and make that a reality.

We provide a platform that allows people to raise funds for their local community utilizing Web3 Technology. With the DeSo API, you'll be able to donate funds to fundraisers using decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). This revolutionary technology allows you to donate to your local community without the need for a middleman.

## What it does 📚📚📚

We built DaFund as an inspiration from other crowdfunding platforms, such as DaFund. The technologies we used included the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, as well as DeSo API, Auth0 for authentication, and Docker and Heroku for deployment.

This was the first time our team ever dealt with Web3 technology, so we had to learn it from scratch. It was an awesome experience to work with such emerging technology, and there were many resources provided by MLH and other creators that guided us through the integration process of the DeSo API.
 
## How we built it 👷‍♀️👷‍♀️👷‍♀️

- We chose to use the DeSo blockchain to minimize costs, and we interact with DeSo using the framework Ethers.js and MetaMask. Lastly, we store our user data in MongoDB and interact with it through a REST API running over an ngrok tunnel. Sends the Post object Diamond Hands post to DESO and returns the formatted Diamond Hand post to the browser.

## Challenges we ran into 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️

- We have set up our Frontend, Backend, and Web3 Infra for our application to function on top of. We have all the DeSo infrastructure that would allow us to issue Diamond Hands.
- We only need the capital to start issuing these NFT's as we had difficulty using the DeSo testnet.
- The biggest challenge was to host the backend as replit was not working with this python-OpenCV, so we had to figure it out and at last, we hosted it using apache, it was a bit overwhelming to write configuration files from scratch and made it accessible over the internet.
- We faced some issues in maps as flutter is a new framework and finding all the solutions are bit difficult compared to other frameworks as lots of packages in flutter are not updated and face null safety issues.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of  🎖️🎖️🎖️

- Creativity Although using Diamond Hands has been mentioned before by Entrepreneurs like Gary Vee we realized that no big corporation has created a decentralized ticket NFT marketplace that could be used to issue tickets by organizers. Thus, we believe that our idea is authentic.

## What we learned 🙇‍♂️📝🙇‍♂️

- Reading the detailed documentation from https://docs.bitclout.com/devs/backend-api was very helpful
- It was the first time we used apache from scratch and exposed an application to the internet.
- Using object detection with a web service

## What's next for DaFund 👁️‍🗨️💡👁️‍🗨️💡

- Real-time trading stock posts similar to Twitter by configuration on Uptimerobot.com, adding new monitor HTTPS, adding DESO URL.
- For the future, we envision our web application to serve as a crowdfunding resource that expands to people worldwide. We wish to scale our web application so that it can extend to many users that wish to use our platform. 
- We want to also incorporate other cryptocurrency donation options, and integrate their APIs properly within our web application. We also wish to improve our user interface/design so that it's more user-friendly.
